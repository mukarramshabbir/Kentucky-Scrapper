# Automate Web

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Browser Settings:
   You need to have a brave browser installed and do these changes in it:
 - Change the Brave browser's default download location to the directory where you have placed the code.py file.
 - Turn off the option "Ask where to save each file before downloading."
 - Adjust the PDF download settings.

I have also created a guide to change these setting which is shown in the video.

- Note: If you want to manually add Excel files then you should add those files in the project directory when program is running and downloading files from browser.

Now just run the code.py file and final output will be in "Data.xlsx" file
